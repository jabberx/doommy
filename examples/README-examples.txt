To run example3.lua you need to download proteaAudio .dll or .so 
and put it in dir where doommy executable resides.
http://viremo.eludi.net/proteaAudio/

Proper way to run examples (Windows):
cd examples
..\doommy example3.lua

Or just put examples and example data folders into folder 
where doommy executable lays and execute doommy with filename.lua
as argument.

"example3-data" folder contains files needed by example3.lua
