About
-----
This is a voxel-based game engine. It's core written in C,
Lua is used for scripting, SDL used for window creation, 
input handling and graphics output. proteaAudio is used 
in one example and is recommended as sound system for your game.
Doommy Voxel Engine is licensed under GPL v3 (see COPYING.txt).
For build information see BUILDING.txt

What does it look like, what benefits it has?
---------------------------------------------
Looks like Voxlap, but uses different algorithm and has 
somewhat crappy quality.

Key benefits are:
- engine is cross-platform
- no 3d-acceleration needed, only CPU used for rendering
- easy to use (only basic Lua knowledge needed to write 
your game or editor or landscape generator or any other 
voxel-related application)
- absolutely free of charge for commercial and non-commercial 
usage, and also free in terms of freedom (GPL v3)

System requirements:
--------------------
Depends on building keys. Recommended to use SSE2 and fast
floating point operations, so such CPUs as Intel Atom/
Intel Celeron [M/D]/Intel Xeon/Intel Pentium 4/Intel Core, 
K-8 based and higher AMDs: Sempron/Athlon 64/Phenom/Opteron
/Turion are required.
Minimal comfortable CPU frequency is 1.5 Ghz (suitable for 
low quality() option).

Usage:
------
doommy script_name.lua
(if no argument passed, it tries to run game.lua)

Examples:
---------
See examples folder. Examples show how to make main cycle,
how to generate level, how to implement shading, collision
detection, "mouselook", camera motion, input handling.
Example3 also contains pre-generated level, music, sounds
and images. Read examples\README-examples.txt

Writing your scripts:
---------------------
See <http://lua.org/> for Lua language basics. This section
contains only engine's Lua API and some notes. Most functions 
names should be self-explanatory.

setup_fullscreen()

setup_window()

  About window size/screen resolution: it is always 640x480.

handle_sdl_events() - essential command for your app's main loop.
The app will "hang" without it. Info for is_key_pressed command
is updated only after handle_sdl_events() call.

ms = get_tick_count() - time in milliseconds passed from program 
start.

set_window_title('title')

draw_fps(fps) - draws fps in top left corner.

draw_voxels() - renders current voxel level.

draw_camera_pos() - draws camera position in top left corner.
Values over 1000 are cropped.

sdl_delay(ms) - delay in milliseconds.

x,y = get_mouse_xy() - relative to window.

set_mouse_xy(x,y) - relative to window.

set_cam_yaw(yaw) - set cam rotation in degrees for Y-axis. Keep
this value in range 0...359.

set_cam_pitch(pitch) - set cam rotation in degrees for X-axis. 
It is common in games to cap it: -90..90.

set_cam_pos(x,y,z) - update camera position in engine.

b = cam_collides() - built-in function, checks for collision with
some margin. apply set_cam_pos(..) before using it. You may want
to write your own collision function in Lua.

x,y,z = get_pointed_voxel_pos() - get voxel position, hit by
viewing ray.

b = is_voxel_empty(x,y,z) - returns 1 if x,y,z voxel is empty.

erase_voxel(x,y,z) - make voxel empty (0).

i = get_voxel_pal(x,y,z) - get voxels color (palette index).
Indexes ranges from 1 to 255 inclusive, 0 means empty voxel.

  About palette: voxel levels stored with indexed palette (1 byte
  for each voxel). Default palette is adapted for smooth lightness
  transitions of limited color tones:
  0 - not used for color, representing empty voxel
  1-32 - from black to white
  33-64 - from dark red to light red
  65-96 - from dark green to light green
  97-128 - from dark blue to light blue
  129-160 - from dark cyan to light cyan
  161-192 - from dark pink to light pink
  193-224 - from dark yellow to light yellow
  225-255 - from dark brown to orange
  Each level stores it's palette in the end of file. There is
  command to edit palette of loaded or created level, see below.

r,g,b = get_voxel_rgb(x,y,z)

set_voxel_pal(x,y,z,index) - set another color index to voxel. 
If 0 is passed, voxel will be erased.

set_voxel_rgb(x,y,z,r,g,b) - finds nearest color from palette
and assigns it's index to voxel.

x,y,z = get_view_ray() - returns normalized view ray

announce_chunk_updates() - do this before any updates once 
update_chunk(x,y,z) - update chunk (piece of level with 
dimensions 32x32x32), to which x,y,z voxel relates.

About chunk updates: after you've changed anything in voxel 
level, you must update altered chunks, otherwise engine won't
be able to render them properly. Each update_chunk(..) 
if effective only once for every chunk, so do all updates at
the end of your loop, after all changes was made. 
announce_chunk_updates() makes possible to update arleady 
updated chunks again. Call this each time in your loop 
before block with updates.

update_all_chunks() - useful when you've generated whole level.
Consumes some time, progress will be shown in title, so you
need to set new title after completion.

remove_isolated_voxels() - removes voxels totally surrounded 
with non-empty voxels. This operation can't speed up rendering,
but level can be compressed better with some archivers.

b = is_key_pressed(keynum) - returns 1 otherwise returns 0. 
There is no EVENTS in Doommy, only states, but this isn't a problem.
You can find key numbers in the end of this document.

  NOTE - 1 isn't the same as true. Doommy's Lua functions never 
  returns anything other than numbers, so 
  if is_key_pressed(key) then ... end won't work! use ==1 comparison.

fake_key_state(keynum,state) - sometimes you need to react only
when key was pressed and ignore that fact that key is still 
being hold. handle_events() won't set the state for holded keys,
it only sets 1 for pressed, and 0 for released and you can fake
that states with fake_key_state.

b = is_button_pressed(N) - returns 1, if mouse button is pressed.
Numbers: left=0, middle=1, right=2, wheel up=3, wheel down=4.

fake_button_state(N,state) - see fake_key_state(..)

show_sdl_cursor()

hide_sdl_cursor()

screen_set_pixel(x,y,r,g,b) - you should only know, that 0,0 
for this function and for circles/lines is located in lower 
left screen/window corner. For images and rects 0,0 will be 
in top left corner.
Program will fall if you're out of 0..639,0..479 range;

screen_set_pixel32(x,y,32bitcolor)

screen_clear(r,g,b)

screen_fill_rect(x,y,w,h,r,g,b) or (x,y,w,h,32bitcolor) - draws
filled rectangle on screen (0,0 - top left).

screen_draw_circle(x,y,radius,r,g,b) or (x,y,radius,32bitcolor) - 
draws circle (0,0 - bottom left).

screen_draw_line(x,y,x2,y2,r,g,b) or (x,y,x2,y2,32bitcolor) - 
draw line (0,0 - bottom left).

b = load_level_from_file(xsize,ysize,zsize,filename) - returns -1 
in case of error, 0 if ok. Current level dissapears.

load_empty_level(xsize,ysize,zsize) - creates in memory new 
empty level with default palette. Current level dissapears.

save_level_to_file(filename) - saves current level with all changes
to voxels and palette into file.

  About level format and size: only voxel bytes and palette 
  are stored. Palette size 255*3 bytes (r,g,b,r,g,b,r,g,b....)
  So, level file size will be xsize*ysize*zsize + 765 bytes.
  You must somehow remember level dimensions by yourself.
  Allowed dimensions: minimal - 64x64x64, dimension should be
  divided by 32 without rest: 64, 128, 160, 256, 1024 e t.c. 
  Maximum level size is limited only by your computers RAM and
  maximum level size allowed by your OS.
  Depending on game type you may want to split your game to
  separate levels. Level with dimension 256x128x256 can contain
  five floors building or small piece of forest with two trees - 
  this depends on abstract scaling you choose. Such level will
  take 8Mb disk space (around 1Mb if compressed with 7z), and
  ~10-11Mb RAM (because +33% will be allocated for algorithm needs).

save_patch_to_file(x,y,z,x2,y2,z2,filename) - saves part of current
level from memory to filename. x2,y2,z2 - is inclusive. 
Requirements: x2>=x, y2>=y, z2>=z, x,y,z>=0, x,y,z<xsize,ysize,zsize 
No palette, dimensions or other information will be saved, just plain
voxel bytes, so you must remember to which level this patch relates,
and what size it has.

load_patch_from_file(x,y,z,x2,y2,z2,filename) - loads previously 
saved patch to given bbox. Unsafe, as save_patch_to_file. Check
everything carefully.

  NOTE: If you don't like long function names, do this at the 
  beginning of your script: load_patch = load_patch_from_file

erase_box(x,y,z,x2,y2,z2)

fill_box_with_rgb(x,y,z,x2,y2,z2,r,g,b)

fill_box_with_index(x,y,z,x2,y2,z2,index)

fill_box_with_noisy_rgb(x,y,z,x2,y2,z2,r,g,b,intensity) - intensity -
is maximum random decrease of index.

fill_box_with_noisy_index(x,y,z,x2,y2,z2,index,intensity) - same as
above, but you pass index directly, not through r,g,b.

erase_sphere(x,y,z,radius) - this is safe (does boundary checks)

  REMEMBER: all this (box/sphere/patch) functions change voxels. 
  To apply that changes you must also update chunks. The only 
  exception is next function: erase_sphere_shaded(x,y,z,r,g,b) - 
  it does updates automatically, but is deprecated.

fill_sphere_with_rgb(x,y,z,radius,r,g,b)

fill_sphere_with_index(x,y,z,radius,index)

fill_sphere_with_noisy_rgb(x,y,z,rad,r,g,b,intensity)

fill_sphere_with_noisy_index(x,y,z,rad,index,intensity)

set_max_dist(maxdist) - sets view/fog distance. Default is 512,
but it is too much. For better depth perception you may want
to set lower values especially for levels without shading.

set_fog_rgb(r,g,b)

  About r,g,b: here r,g,b means values 0..255

swap_buffers() - call this function after you've rendered everything
you wanted. Without this function you will see nothing.

set_palette(index,r,g,b) - change palette color of selected index.
Index - from 1 до 255. You should know, that after this operation 
commands with rgb suffixes won't work properly unless you call 
reinit_palette() (somewhat slow, don't call often).

  Again about palette: when you create new empty level, default 
  palette loads. When you save some level, current palette 
  saves with it. When you load level, it's palette loads with it.

draw_3d_pixel(x,y,z,r,g,b) - projects 3d point on screen and draws
as pixel if it passes z-buffer. x,y,z may be float values.

  NOTE: There's no point to call draw_3d..., draw_image, draw_line 
  before draw_voxels(), cause draw_voxels() will cover all screen.

draw_3d_quad(x,y,z,r,g,b,scale_divider,max_quad_size) - projects
3d point/voxel and draws it as quad, which increases it's size
when camera approaches. You should increase scale_divider 
(normal value - 2) when points located more closely (0.5, 1, 1.5).
max_quad_size - after reaching this width quad will stop to grow.
draw_3d_quad suitable for drawing weapons/tools, animated enemys,
items and particle effects.
About performance: attempt to render ~25000 such quads can cause
double FPS fall. ~12500 квадратов - one and half, ~2000-4000 is
good, ~500-1000 - almost unnoticeable.

draw_3d_wire(x,y,z,x2,y2,z2,r,g,b) - projects two 3d points to
screen and draws line without depth-testing if points are on
screen. Divide big lines into smaller segments.

low_quality() - essential options for slow computers such as
old netbooks. Makes voxel resolution lower and greatly increases
frames per seconds. Always leave in your game a way to turn this
option on.

med_quality() - restores normal resolution. There's no high_quality
setting yet.

take_screenshot(filename) - saves screenshot as bmp

reset_palette() - loads default palette described above.

force_single_thread() - by default on double core CPUs all two 
cores are used. You can switch that off with this command if
one core is powerful enough (3GHz). As benefit - some artifacts 
at the left side of screen will dissapear, but everything will 
be two times slower.

img_id = load_image(filename,magenta_transparent?) - loads BMP 
into memory and returns pointer to it. If you pass 1 as 
magenta_transparent, magenta (FF00FF) pixels will be considered
transparent while blitting this image.

draw_image(x,y,imageID) - 0,0 - in top left.

draw_image_part(x,y,clip_x,clip_y,clip_w,clip_h,imageID) - may 
be useful for spritesheets or bitmap fonts (Doommy has no built-in
font).

unload_image(imageID) - frees resource. Don't use this often or
in a loop, because this may cause segmentation fault. The only
reason to use this function - really big image (or series of
images) loaded into memory and you don't need them anymore and
want to free some RAM.

set_image_pixel(x,y,r,g,b,imageID)

r,g,b=get_image_pixel(x,y,imageID)

n = perlin_noise_3d(x,y,z) - Perlin's noise. Useful to generate
landscapes, caves, etc. Don't forget to multiply values by
scaling, e.g. *0.02 otherwise you'll receive just noise. 
Returns value in range -1.0..1.0

b = is_focused() - returns 1 if window is in focus, otherwise - 0.

disable_checkers()/enable_checkers() have no effect anymore, no point
to disable this effect, because on powerful CPUs its hard to see it,
and on slow CPUs this effect is saviour.

x,y,z,index = throw_ray(dirx,diry,dirz,posx,posy,posz,max_dist) - 
Returns position and color of voxel, that was hit by ray.
You don't need to divide dir or to alter pos somehow before passing,
dir just need to be normalized.
You can use alias of this function: throw_ray_to_dir.

x,y,z,index = throw_ray_to_pos(destx,desty,destz,startx,starty,startz) - 
Computes ray and returns position and color of voxel, that was hit 
by that ray. Can be used to calculate lighting (dest - lighting pos,
startx - voxel pos).

Sound:
------
You can use proteaAudio, details here: 
http://viremo.eludi.net/proteaAudio/proteaaudiolua.html

Initialization might look like this:
require("proAudioRt")
proAudio.create(8,44100,1024)

Loading samples:
dig_sound = proAudio.sampleFromFile("data\\dig.wav")
music = proAudio.sampleFromFile("data\\loop.ogg")

Playing looped music (25% volume for both channels):
proAudio.soundLoop (music, 0.25, 0.25)

Playing one-shot sample:
proAudio.soundPlay(dig_sound)

Although it is beyond the scope of voxel engine's duites, here is
example how to make 3d sound using proteaAudio:
  --[[

Some troubleshooting:
---------------------
Window showed and dissapeared, what to do? - Read error.log, 
check function and variable names, maybe you made a mistake somewhere.

Error "memory can't be read/write" on Windows, error.log is empty, 
what to do? - likely you've tried to access memory you don't have
right to access. For example, out of boundaries of some array
(level/patches/palette/screen/BMP pixels etc).
